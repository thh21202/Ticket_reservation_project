# Ticket_reservation_project
(I recommend reading this in "code" format instead of "preview" for readability).

How to run this program:
1. Download all 12 files
2. Run it on your IDE or onlinegdb.com
3. For testing:
   3.1: open userdb.dat (the first field is the username and the second field is their password)
   3.2: run the program
   3.3: enter username (e.g. moondragon)
   3.4: enter password (e.g. abc1 -- this is the password for moondragon)
   3.5: a menu should pop up and wait for your action. If you see this then the program is working successfully.

(This is from the project desrciption):
The theater owner you have been working for this semester is very pleased with your work, and wants
to provide expanded customer service by building a reservation system to track customer orders before next
yearâ€™s summer movie season. The customers need the ability to login to the system and access their orders. The
customers should have the ability to add orders, change orders or cancel orders as well as the ability to see the
receipts for their orders. The reservation system should also have an administrator interface.
